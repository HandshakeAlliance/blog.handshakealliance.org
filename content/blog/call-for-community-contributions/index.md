title: A Call for Community Contributions
date: "2019-11-26"
description: "Handshake Alliance's call for community contributions to the Handshake ecosystem."
---

The purpose of this post is to help communicate what we feel is left for the community to help with when it comes to supporting the development of Handshake. While not all of the things that we plan to list below, are "need-to-haves", everything that exists in this list is a "want-to-have" for Handshake. The more of the following that the community can help tackle, the easier and smoother the Handshake launch should be. 

We've listed some of the larger projects that we feel have higher priority, followed by a list of remaining projects. We are open to increasing this list, so please send a PR to this blog post if you feel we are missing something!

## Experimental Testnet
@TODO - Link
As explained in this issue on Github, we believe that an experimental testnet would be a great next-step for Handshake. Many highly technical things have changed since the last testnet was launched including the new proof of work, and airdrop stability. It would seem prudent for the community to support a testnet that can help test out this new tech to insure that it works as intended. While we do believe that what is being introduced into Handshake is solid from a technical standpoint, all software has bugs, and the last testnet helped flesh out a few critical bugs - so we belive its only prudent to do the same with this new tech. 

Our goal is to launch this new testnet by November 28th, if you are interested in helping to run a seed node on this testnet please comment on the issue linked above.

## Protocol Documenation

Another large goal we see as needed before Handshake reaches mainnet is the development of a Handshake wiki, akin to the Bitcoin wiki. 

Although Handshake is forked from Bitcoin, there are enough changes that a full wiki to help explain some of the technical aspects of Handshake seems warranted. 

We've started a repository for the Handshake Wiki here: @TODO

## Handshake Academy

Similar to the above wiki, a place where non-techincal users can come to learn about Handshake and how it can be used. Our original goal for this was the Handshake Academy, although admitedly we have let it fall by the wasteside while working on other projects. 

We plan to fully rewrite the academy in a language that is more user friendly for outside contributors from a code point of view, but where we really need some help is the content. Currently, we are just a small team of developers, so those who can contribute educational posts would be able to make a large difference. 


## RSD

We have begun a full rewrite of Handshake into Rust named RSD. The development of RSD has helped us catch a number of bugs and improvements that have led to fixes in HSD. That being said, we've mainly tackled all of the low-hanging fruit when it comes to RSD development. There are a number of large projects that must be completed in order for RSD to be a fully working node. 

We'll go into depth on that subject further in another post - in the meantime check out the RSD repository if you want to get started! @TODO


## Misc

These are the remaining projects that we feel need some attention, but we have not started. Feel free to tackle one of the following!

- Fuzzing Infrastracture
- Testing HNScan
- Handshake Networking Protocol Documentation
- OpenAPI Spec for Handshake's HTTP endpoints
- Testing Elligator
